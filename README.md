# The Game of Life in Python (pygame)
This is an implementation of [The Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) using [pygame](https://www.pygame.org).

When the game is lauched you set the initial board using the cursor. Then press the down key to start the game. To stop the game press the down key again.

There is a fixed size on the board game, which can be changed in the [Variables.py](Variables.py) file. There it is also possible to change the size of each block/cell.
